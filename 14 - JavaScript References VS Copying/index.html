      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      const newPlayers = players;

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // newPlayers[2] = "Ayberk" // Also affect players array
      // console.log(players)

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // ===COPY=== //
      const newerPlayers = players.slice();

      newerPlayers[2] = "Ayberk";
      // console.log(newerPlayers)
      // console.log(players)
      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const ultraNewerPlayers = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const newestPlayers = [...players];
      const beyondNewPlayers = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const newPerson = person; // A reference which effects person object too
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 22 });
      console.log(person2);
      console.log(person);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const person3 = { ...person };
      console.log(person3);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
